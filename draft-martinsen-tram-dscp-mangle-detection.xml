    <abstract>
      <t>
        This document describes a mechanism for an endpoint to
        measure if the network "mangles" DSCP values.

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        In some use-cases is useful to know if the network path changes
        the DSCP/TOS values in the IP header.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document introduces a new STUN attribute that can carry
        the original DSCP/TOS values. This enables the remote receiver
        to compare the values in the IP header and the STUN attribute
        to detect mangling. 
      </t>
      <t>
        The information in the STUN attribute is probably of little
        interest for the remote receiver. The main use case is to
        collect metrics regarding how often DSCP values are mangled.  
      </t>
      <t>
        ICE could potentially also use this information to prefer
        paths with intact DSCP markings.
      </t>
      <t>
        (Just assigning a attribute from IANA is possible, but we
        thought it was better to have a draft describing the attribute
        so everyone knows what it is)

          The Tx DSCP value field is populated with the value of the
          DSCP/TOS field of the IP packet carrying the STUN
          response. the Rx DSCP value is populated with the value from
          the DSCP/TOS field from the packet carrying the original
          receiving STUN request.

      <section anchor="example_operation" title="Example Operation">
        <t>
          When a client receives the response it can compare the
          values of in the DSCP_VALUE attribute with values from the
          IP socket. The results could be used to detect and collect
          metrics regarding DSCP "survivability" on the Internet. It
          could possible also influence ICE path decisions.

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>[Paragraphs in braces should be removed by the RFC Editor
      upon publication]</t>

      <t>[The TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute requires that IANA
      allocate a value in the "STUN attributes Registry" from the
      comprehension-optional range (0x8000-0xBFFF), to be replaced for
      TBD-CA throughout this document]</t>

      <t>This document defines the DSCP_VALUE STUN attribute,
      described in <xref target="alg_over"></xref>. IANA has allocated
      the comprehension-optional code-point TBD-CA for this
      attribute.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        Security considerations discussed in <xref
        target="RFC5389"></xref> are to be taken into account. STUN
        requires the 96 bits transaction ID to be uniformly and
        randomly chosen from the interval 0 .. 2**96-1, and be
        cryptographically strong. This is good enough security against
        an off-path attacker. An on-path attacker can either inject a
        fake response or modify the values in
        DSCP_VALUE attribute to mislead the client
        and server. This attack can be mitigated using STUN
        authentication. As DSCP_VALUE is expected to
        be used between peers using ICE, and ICE uses STUN short-term
        credential mechanism the risk of on-path attack influencing
        the messages is minimal. If DSCP_VALUE is
        used with Allocate request then STUN long-term credential
        mechanism or STUN Extension for Third-Party Authorization
        <xref target="RFC7635"></xref> or (D)TLS connection can be
        used between the TURN client and the TURN server to prevent
        attackers from trying to impersonate a TURN server and sending
        bogus DSCP_VALUE attribute in the Allocate
        response. 
      </t>
      <t>
        The information sent in any STUN packet if not encrypted can
        potentially be observed passively and used for reconnaissance
        and later attacks.
